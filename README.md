# Qr_Generator_XTZ
This is a simple Qr code generator. It is made with artists who are using Tezos NFT tokens for their artwork in mind. The idea being you can now print a qr code that ties your physical work to your nft version if you wish.
Currently it is only a python script and does not work as a stand alone program. I could use some help there.
